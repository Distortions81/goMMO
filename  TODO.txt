Healing:
maybe also different sprite for the healer?
Need to think about how we can do the effect without new sprites.
Eventually use target system for targeted

Current:
Test if bit-packed networking is faster or slower.
Edit mode: only moderators, remove & move objects
controller inputs
player guest / login / create login ### goMMOLogin on laptop? ###
 make sprite compositor, for clothing/weapons/etc
 fix mouse/touch walk being eaten by UI elements
add first few sounds
draw sorting enhancements

Future:
Look into threading physics by using two-step like:
https://github.com/Distortions81/Gravity-Simulation-Golang/blob/main/main.go
Clear chunks from players on edit, write net/client so client can also clear.

Bit pack networking:
7.5 UPS: 10 players, 10 creatures
Current:
340 bytes per frame, 2550 bytes/sec
10k players, 194 megabit uplink.

###################################
Bit-packed (APPROX)
180 bytes per frame, 1350 bytes/sec
10k players, 87 megabit uplink

Could save 50% or more bandwidth.
Need to invistigate CPU use.
