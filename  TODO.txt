Edit mode: only moderators, remove & move objects

bit-pack networking
object flags:
locked, static or dynamic, on-ground

controller inputs
make non-pixel doubled mode for small screens/mobile
player guest / login / create login

 make sprite compositor, for clothing/weapons/etc
 fix mouse/touch walk being eaten by UI elements

add first few sounds, at least one enemy (zombie)

Healing:
maybe also different sprite for the healer?
Need to think about how we can do the effect without new sprites.
Eventually use target system for targeted, add flags.
Test if bit-packed networking is faster or slower.


Future:
Look into threading physics by using two-step like:
