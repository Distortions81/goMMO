Healing:
maybe also different sprite for the healer?
Need to think about how we can do the effect without new sprites.
Eventually use target system for targeted, add flags.

Current:
Test if bit-packed networking is faster or slower.
Edit mode: only moderators, remove & move objects
object flags: locked, static or dynamic, on-ground
controller inputs
player guest / login / create login
 make sprite compositor, for clothing/weapons/etc
 fix mouse/touch walk being eaten by UI elements
add first few sounds, at least one enemy (zombie)
draw sorting

Future:
Look into threading physics by using two-step like:

Clear chunks from players on edit, write net/client so client can also clear.
