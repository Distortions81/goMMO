Healing:
maybe also different sprite for the healer?
Need to think about how we can do the effect without new sprites.
Eventually use target system for targeted

Current:
Test if bit-packed networking is faster or slower.
Edit mode: only moderators, remove & move objects
controller inputs
player guest / login / create login
 make sprite compositor, for clothing/weapons/etc
 fix mouse/touch walk being eaten by UI elements
add first few sounds
draw sorting enhancements

Future:
Look into threading physics by using two-step like:

Clear chunks from players on edit, write net/client so client can also clear.

### Refine client side smoothing, currently jumps when changing direction.
