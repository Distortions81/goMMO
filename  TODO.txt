Healing:
maybe also different sprite for the healer?
Need to think about how we can do the effect without new sprites.
Eventually use target system for targeted

Current:
Edit mode: only moderators, remove & move objects
controller inputs
player guest / login / create login ### goMMOLogin on laptop? ###
 make sprite compositor, for clothing/weapons/etc
 fix mouse/touch walk being eaten by UI elements
add first few sounds
draw sorting enhancements

New:
Move player direction to server-side.
A* pathing, for click-walkto and creature pathing.
Perlin noise for terrain "base"?
Write-off network bit-packing, small savings with added complexity.

Future:
Look into threading physics by using two-step like:

Clear chunks from players on edit, write net/client so client can also clear.
