Edit mode:
Characters marked mod or on dev mode only?
Optimize CPU: cache each chunk's data serialization for one frame?
Test bit-packed networking.

Finish save/load world.

Make flags for world objects:
live (not in world file on client),
physical (collisions)/(otherwise, draw on ground), radius (collision circle), rect (collision rect),
locked (confirm delete), dirty (unsaved)

Look into a system to convert live objects to standard...
Maybe a command at connect to download new items, and to all players connected when changes are made.
I think it would be best if we do this at X amount per frame to throttle the download (x segments, based on kb/sec?)... or on a different server.

Chunk dirty flag, timer, lock, autosave.
