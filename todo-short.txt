Edit mode:
Characters marked mod
(save/load players, quick login creation)

Test bit-packed networking.

Make flags for world objects:
live (not in world file on client),
physical (collisions)/(otherwise, draw on ground), radius (collision circle), rect (collision rect),
locked (confirm delete)

Look into a system to convert live objects to standard...
Maybe a command at connect to download new items, and to all players connected when changes are made.
I think it would be best if we do this at X amount per frame to throttle the download (x segments, based on kb/sec?)... or on a different server.

Controller inputs (mouse/touch walk added)
Don't pixel-double on very small windows (mobile)

only check chunks within radius of player!
