Characters marked mod
(save/load players, quick login creation)

Test bit-packed networking.

Make flags for world objects:
live (not in world file on client),
physical (collisions)/(otherwise, draw on ground), radius (collision circle), rect (collision rect),
locked (confirm delete)

Look into a system to convert live objects to standard...
Maybe a command at connect to download new items, and to all players connected when changes are made.
I think it would be best if we do this at X amount per frame to throttle the download (x segments, based on kb/sec?)... or on a different server.

Controller inputs (mouse/touch walk added)
Don't pixel-double on very small windows (mobile)

only check chunks within radius of player!

##############################
## Write object data sending
## Then add basic attack
## player login
## finish player mode, editor delete/move

Switch sprite sheets for sword/heal,
start work on attack/heal sprite sheets and logic.

$$$ don't stop walking if UI/window eat event

** from discord **
Needs event rates (swing), effectiveness and the animations...
I will replace it later, when I make the new sprite system. It needs to take several sprites (parts) and composite them and cache it.
For different weapons, clothing, etc.
(so I don't have to draw/make a million sprites)


Working on:
Network bandwidth optimizations
Passive/Attack/Heal modes -- WIP
Guest Login, create login
Editor mode move/delete 

*** change targeting to collison for simplicity and multi-target.
Use closest target if not allowing multi-target.
